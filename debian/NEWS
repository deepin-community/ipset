ipset (6.14-2) experimental; urgency=low

  This version has moved the ipset binary and library to /sbin and
  /lib/[arch triplet] respectively.

  The ipset should setup the *set* correctly even the system could not mount
  /usr as same as the iptables does.

  You must ensure that the customized scripts should call the binary
  /sbin/ipset instead.

  Note: This version not fully supports the issue of /usr not mounted yet,
  as ipset is still depending on libmnl which installed in /usr/lib.
  It's still in this state until the libmnl move their library to /lib.
